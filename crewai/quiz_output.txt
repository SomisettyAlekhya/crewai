Q1: What is Machine Learning?
A1: Machine Learning enables computers to learn patterns from data.

Q2: What is training data?
A2: Training data is the information used to teach the model.

Q3: What is a model?
A3: A model is an algorithm trained to make predictions from data.

Q4: What is overfitting?
A4: Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too closely and fails on new data.

Q5: What is a neural network?
